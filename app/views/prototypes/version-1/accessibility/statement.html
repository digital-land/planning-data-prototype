      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement</h1>

   <p>This accessibility statement applies to the planning.data.gov.uk website: <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk">https://www.planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>
   <p>This website is run by the Planning Data team in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities</p>
   <p>We are always working to improve our website and want as many people as possible to be able to access and use it. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

    <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand. <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/"> AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
  
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>

    <p>We have performed an internal accessibility audit following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Evaluation Method (WCAG-EM)</p>
    <p>On 50 of 50 WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criteria, at the time of writing this website:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>29 Passed</li>
      <li>6 Failed</li>
      <li>1 Cannot tell</li>
      <li>14 Not present</li>
      <li>0 Not checked</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Where we failed web content accessibility guidelines</h3>
    
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.1.1: Non-text Content</h4>

  <p>Aspects of the National Map show do not have a text alternative such as street labels and locations.</p>
  
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.3.2: Meaningful Sequence</h4>

    <p>Some pages need heading levels and reading order adjusted to make comprehension and way finding easier</p>
  
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.3.3: Sensory Characteristics</h4>

  <p>National Map of planning data currently relies on the ability to see shapes, colours and visual locations. A 'non map alternative' is required for users unable able perceive content visually.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.4.1: Use of Color</h4>

  <p>The National Map of Planning Data currently relies on colour to distinguish geographic shapes from one dataset to another.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)</h4>

  <p>The National Map of Planning Data fails colour contrast for map features and data layers. Text labels for locations can become difficult to read and are not a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">1.4.11: Non-text Contrast</h4>

  <p>The National Map of Planning has shapes and areas of colour that when overlayed do not have sufficient contrast.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">2.1.1: Keyboard</h4>

  <p>Features of the National Map of Planning Data are not able to be access via a keyboard.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">3.2.2: On Input</h4>

  <p>Search functionality on the <a href="">dataset index</a> and <a href="">organisation index</a> performs an update to page content by filtering a list of links. It is a change of content that could be a 'change of context' because the viewport changes height and potentially scroll position as the number list items increases or decreases.</p>
  
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">3.3.1: Error Identification</h4>

  <p>In the 'search' page. There is functionality to search for a dataset to facet search results by. However there is no visual feedback if the user types a search with no results, the content is visually hidden.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What we plan to do next</h3>

  <p>We will outsource an accessibility audit on this website in the near future and fix as many of the issues that are found as possible.</p>
